# GitHub Copilot Instructions for Podr Service

## Project Overview
This is a Cloudflare Workers-based RESTful API service for https://www.podrapp.com/ that provides podcast search and discovery functionality through the iTunes API.

## Technology Stack
- **Runtime**: Cloudflare Workers
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Package Manager**: Yarn
- **Testing**: Jest with service-worker-mock
- **Linting**: ESLint with TypeScript support
- **Formatting**: Prettier

## Code Style Guidelines

### TypeScript
- Use strict TypeScript with explicit return types for functions
- Prefer interfaces for object shapes
- Use const for immutable values
- Follow the existing ESLint configuration

### Cloudflare Workers Patterns
- Use modern Module Worker pattern with `export default { fetch: ... }`
- Leverage the `Request`, `Response`, `env`, and `ctx` parameters
- Use `ctx.waitUntil()` for background tasks that shouldn't block responses
- Implement proper error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes

### Code Organization
- Keep API logic in the main worker file
- Use TypeScript interfaces for data structures
- Document functions with JSDoc comments
- Follow single responsibility principle

## Development Workflow

### Before Making Changes
```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Run linter
yarn lint

# Run tests
yarn test

# Build project
yarn build
```

### Making Changes
1. Write tests first when adding new functionality
2. Ensure code passes linting: `yarn lint`
3. Format code with Prettier: `yarn format`
4. Verify tests pass: `yarn test`
5. Verify build succeeds: `yarn build`

### Common Commands
- `yarn dev` - Start local development server with Wrangler
- `yarn lint:fix` - Auto-fix linting issues
- `yarn test:watch` - Run tests in watch mode
- `yarn deploy` - Deploy to Cloudflare Workers

## API Design Principles
- RESTful endpoints using GET requests
- Return JSON responses with appropriate CORS headers
- Use query parameters for search criteria
- Implement proper error handling with descriptive messages
- Keep responses cacheable where appropriate

## Testing Guidelines
- Use Jest with service-worker-mock for testing Workers
- Test happy paths and error conditions
- Mock external API calls (iTunes API)
- Maintain test coverage for critical paths

## Security Considerations
- Sanitize and validate all user inputs
- Use CORS headers appropriately
- Follow Cloudflare Workers security best practices
- Keep dependencies up to date via Dependabot

## Performance Best Practices
- Minimize response sizes
- Leverage Cloudflare's edge caching
- Use efficient data structures
- Avoid blocking operations in the main request path

## CI/CD
- GitHub Actions run on push and pull requests
- All code must pass linting and tests
- Build must succeed on Node.js 20, 22, and 24
- Security scans are performed automatically
